save events for each hour of your day.

I created this day planner that saves your schedule through the day to the local storage.
I used getItem method to retrieve the data from the local storage whenever the page is refreshed.
I used .text(moment().format() for time and date updates.
i also used if function to differentiate the color in time blocks.


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
